    "### <span style=\"color:#ff69b4;\">1. Early Prescriptions Have Greater Variability</span>\n",
    "- In both medA and medB, early prescriptions (p_number 2, 3, 4) exhibit high variability in event intervals.\n",
    "- Large spreads in refill durations, with outliers reaching up to 500 days for medA and 300 days for medB.\n",
    "- This suggests that early refills are irregular, possibly due to patients adjusting to their medication schedules or inconsistencies in initial prescription adherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ff69b4;\">2. Convergence in Later Prescriptions</span>\n",
    "- As the p_number increases (above 10 for medA, above 15–20 for medB), refill intervals stabilize.\n",
    "- Boxplots narrow, indicating more predictable refill patterns with fewer extreme outliers.\n",
    "- Maximum durations decrease, suggesting that patients develop a routine over time.\n",

    "    - Broader refill variation in the early phase.\n",
    "    - Outliers in refill intervals suggest some patients delay refills significantly.\n",
    "    - Later refill intervals are shorter, indicating more consistent adherence over time.\n",
    "- **MedB**\n",
    "    - Generally shorter refill intervals compared to medA.\n",
    "    - More frequent prescriptions suggest higher dosage frequency or a stricter regimen.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#ff69b4;\">1. Early Prescriptions Show More Outliers and Noise</span>\n",
    "- DBSCAN identified a significant number of noise points in early refills, particularly in medA.\n",
    "- Outliers in refill durations exceed 300–500 days, more than K-Means detected.\n",
    "- The clustering suggests a subset of patients with highly irregular early refill behavior.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#ff69b4;\">2. Later Prescriptions Form Well-Defined Clusters</span>\n",
    "- DBSCAN was better at grouping consistent refill intervals while ignoring noise.\n",
    "- For p_numbers above 10–15, clusters became denser and more defined, indicating a transition to routine refill behavior.\n",

    "    - medA had a higher number of outliers and noise points in the early prescription phase.\n",
    "    - medB showed more distinct, compact clusters, suggesting better adherence.\n",
    "- **Refill Interval Trends**\n",
    "    - medA: DBSCAN found a wider range of refill intervals, supporting the observation that some patients had extreme delays in early refills.\n",
    "    - medB: DBSCAN grouped refills into shorter, more frequent clusters, reinforcing the idea that medB patients have shorter prescription cycles.\n",
    "- **Noise Handling**\n",
    "    - DBSCAN classified a portion of early refills as noise, meaning those prescriptions did not fit into any clear pattern.\n",
    "    - This suggests a need for further investigation into patient adherence in the early phases.\n",
